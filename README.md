# Augmented-Windows-Command-Line-Utilities
Exposes regular tasks as batch files which are added to the system path to augment the existing list of commands that windows CLI recognises
- **sudo:** Runs a cmd with Administrative privileges 
- **touch:** Creates a new file
- **gedit:** Opens the file in notepad++ for editing
- **sublime:** Opens the sublime editor in the CWD

All these commands have limited functionality as of now. It would be great to expand the functionality of these commands as it brings the comfort of a smooth workflow to the devloper and the power of CLI.

Set-Up Instructions:
==============
- Clone the project
- Set your system path to point to the root of the project
- Modify the config.json file to point to specific resources on your system
